# C - Preprocessor

The C preprocessor is a component of the C programming language that performs text manipulation on the source code before it is compiled.It is responsible for handling preprocessor directives, which are special instructions that start with a '#' character.

The preprocessor's main purpose is to perform textual substitutions in the source code, based on the directives it encounters. These substitutions are typically used for conditional compilation, macro expansion, and file inclusion.
