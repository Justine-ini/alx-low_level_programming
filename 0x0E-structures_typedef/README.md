# C - Structures, typedef

In C programming, structures are user-defined data types that allow you to combine different variables of different types into a single entity. They are used to represent a collection of related data elements, often referred to as members or fields, under one name.

In C, the typedef keyword is used to create an alias or a new name for an existing data type, including structures. It allows you to define a new name for a structure type, which can make your code more readable and manageable.
